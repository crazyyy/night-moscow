= What is Auto Load Next Post? =
Auto Load Next Post simply loads the next post on your blog automatically once the user has reached the bottom of the initial post. This is repeated until there are no more posts to load.

The post navigation at the end of each post is detected to collect the previous post URL for the next post to load. The Javacript then loads the post by inserting the content via a partial template underneath the parent post.

As it does this, your browser URL address bar and page title changes to the post that it has loaded. Should you refresh the browser, the post you were currently reading would load as the initial post.

Your browser still retains the history of the posts that were viewed on the blog.

= First Time Users =
For new first time users I suggest reading [the documentation](https://github.com/seb86/Auto-Load-Next-Post/wiki) to understand how to setup the plugin and see how it works. By default when the plugin is activated, the settings are ready to be used with WordPress's core theme, Twenty Fifteen.

= Features =
* Use action hooks to load content before and after the next post has loaded. [Example Plugin](https://github.com/seb86/Auto-Load-Next-Post-Hooks-Example)
* Have the option to hide the comments if you wish.
* Track each post load with Google Analytics. ***Requires Google Analytics to be applied on your site first for this to work.***
* Over-writable template file.
* WordPress Network / Multisite support.

== Installation ==
Installing "Auto Load Next Post" can be done either by searching for "Auto Load Next Post" via the "Plugins > Add New" screen in your WordPress dashboard, or by using the following steps:

1. Download the plugin via WordPress.org
2. Upload the ZIP file through the 'Plugins > Add New > Upload' screen in your WordPress dashboard.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Go to the plugin settings page 'Settings > Auto Load Next Post'.
5. Enter each of the containers specified for the theme you are using and press "Save Changes".

Once you have activated the plugin, you may get an admin notice telling you that you have not declared support for the plugin. This is perfectly normal and with a little setting up, the notification will remove automatically. There are two buttons. The first leads you to documentation to help you support the plugin. The second allows you to force hide the admin notice. - This notification does not show for any of WordPress core themes.

See [documentation](https://github.com/seb86/Auto-Load-Next-Post/wiki) for more information.

= How do I enable theme support for the plugin? =

Simple add this to your ***functions.php*** file.<br />
> ```add_theme_support('auto-load-next-post');```<br />

Then setup the selectors for your theme in the settings page.

= Where's the settings screen? =

Settings > Auto Load Next Post.

= Is overriding the template file required? =

No. This was put in place to support themes that have coded their template files differently from WordPress standard code.

= How can I override the default template file? =

Simply create a new folder in your theme like so: ***your-theme/auto-load-next-post/*** and copy the template file ***content-partial.php*** into that new folder. Modify it to match your theme and from now on the plugin will load that template file instead.

= Is it compatible with the JetPack's related posts module? =

Yes, you will need to follow [this documentation](https://jetpack.com/support/related-posts/customize-related-posts/#shortcode) provided by JetPack in order to apply it to the template file ***content-partial.php*** within your theme using the shortcode. You can also use the action hooks already put in place within the template file instead if you don't need to copy the template file to your theme.

= You mentioned action hooks to load content before and after the next post has loaded. What are they? =

The action hooks are documented on the GitHub repository along with an example on how to use them. I have also prepared a [plugin](https://github.com/seb86/Auto-Load-Next-Post-Hooks-Example) that shows you an example of added content using the hooks.

= After the first post has loaded, all I get is the same post over and over again. Why is that? =

If you created your own ***content-partial.php*** file, you may have placed the post navigation outside of the post query. You need to place it inside the loop. If that is not the case then you have not included the content of the post correctly.

= Does the plugin detect my theme and insert the correct selectors for me? =

No it does not, but this will be available in the premium version. However this will only work with themes that have been tested and approved.

= My theme does not work with the plugin, what do I do? =

You may need to copy and modify the template file ***content-partial.php*** in order to support your theme. Not all themes are coded the same way so some alterations will be needed. If you need help with this then create a support ticket and I will do my best to help you.

= I'm confused about the post order. Why is the plugin called Auto Load Next Post? =

Well, WordPress loads posts in descending order by default so the next post is the previous post and a user reads content going down not up so it loads the next post, not previous.

= How can I get the Google Analytics option to work? =

You first need to have Google Analytics added to your site. Either by inserting the analytics into your theme yourself or by using the [Google Analytics by Yoast](https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/) plugin.

= Does Auto Load Next Post support WordPress Network / Multisite websites? =

It does. Just make sure that you activate the plugin on the site you want it used on and then make sure the selectors match the theme the site is using.
